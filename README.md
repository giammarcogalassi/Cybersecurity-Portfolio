# Cybersecurity Portfolio

This repository documents my journey in cybersecurity, featuring practical labs, vulnerability assessments, and hands-on penetration testing experiences. It showcases both theoretical knowledge and practical skills developed through structured learning and self-directed research.

**Current Focus**: eJPT certification preparation, practical penetration testing, and network security analysis.

## üéØ Current Skills & Expertise

### Network Security
- Port scanning and network discovery (Nmap)
- Vulnerability assessment (Nessus) 
- Network traffic analysis (Wireshark)
- MITM attacks and ARP poisoning
- Protocol analysis (SMB, NetBIOS, HTTP/HTTPS)

### Penetration Testing
- Metasploit Framework exploitation
- EternalBlue (MS17-010) exploitation
- Post-exploitation with Meterpreter
- Windows privilege escalation
- Web application testing (Burp Suite, DVWA)

### Tools & Frameworks
- **Reconnaissance**: Nmap, arp-scan, Netcat
- **Exploitation**: Metasploit, Ettercap, Hydra
- **Analysis**: Wireshark, Burp Suite
- **Systems**: Kali Linux, VirtualBox lab environment
